          <p>Legislation is necessarily in the public domain since it must be available to everyone, including judiciary institutions. However, our laws are very difficult to access because they are each published in different versions and in different factbooks, themselves from different nations. This excessive decentralization of our legislation calls into question its belonging to the public domain; it also weakens our judicial system. In order to guarantee transparency of the political process of our region, its democracy as well as its justice, it is essential that each one of us can freely access and consult the legislation easily.</p>
          <p>Centralizing New World Union legislation in a Legislative Journal is my solution to this problem. The Legislative Journal will be kept up-to-date by the Regional Government, under executive prerogatives granted to the Regional Government by the Constitution of New World Union. The Legislative Journal will constitute the new legislation on which the functioning of the institutions of our region rests.</p>

          <p>I note that the solution of two regional maps is doomed to failure. This solution is incompatible with our region for some obvious reasons. First: our region is based on a relatively fast pace of roleplay compared to other NationStates regions. Our region is used to numerous, short and reactive roleplays, with players able to respond within 30 minutes. However, the creation of a second map has slowed down this pace in our region, because it has imposed extra work time: maintenance of the card, creation of its background, maintenance of its roleplay, etc.</p>
          <p>The second reason is: New World Union is a relatively conservative region, to understand that the region wants to keep what works at home and that seems familiar. However, at the time, the creation of a second map by Razzgriz was somewhat an innovative idea for the region, so innovative that it unfortunately aroused very little interest.</p>
          <p>For the sake of pragmatism, clarity and simplicity, to avoid widespread confusion about roleplays and maps, and to keep what makes our region functionning, I think it is essential to put an end to the solution of two regional maps. My solution is the return to a single general regional map. Nations with different time frames or technologies will have to adopt this general map; however, they will be able to retain their specificities by justifying them with historical contextualisations compatible with the background of the general map.</p>

    <h2>Stability</h2>
    <p>Advancement of this principle:</p>

        <p>In recent months, the region has experienced violent turmoil among many of its most influent players (honestly, I admit to being part of these players). These violent conflicts have tarnished the region and paralyzed it. Exceptional players like Gooutofhere have decided to leave the region in order to express their exhaust of this situation.</p>
        <p>In order to stabilize the region, and to allow it to heal the wounds of the past, it is essential to establish an intransigent order, capable of preventing future conflicts. Therefore, my solution to this scourge of our region is the creation of an intransigent order capable of preventing future conflicts between players, and if necessary to apply sanctions in case of serious disturbance to the stability of the region.</p>
        <p>This order, to be functional, needs three things: the support of the people, effective institutional tools to fight against conflicts and punish them, constancy and intransigence in the fight against conflicts between players. If I am elected, the first of the prerequisites, and the most important of this project, will be obtained legally. I undertake to produce a law describing the functioning of the order I wish to found, its prerogatives as well as its aims. This legislation will be submitted to a democratic vote in which all Members can express their choice. The second prerequisite will be the use of the legislation of the region (the Legislative Journal), the new text of law on the order and judicial instances of the region. The use of justice will relieve tensions and provide sanctions for disturbance generators. Finally, the third prerequisite will be respected when the Regional Government will lead an active campaign against conflicts between players. If I am elected, I will commit myself to creating a new ministry for player relations, which can also call justice if needed.</p>

        <p>In recent months, the region has experienced a significant decline in activity. The general bad atmosphere and the lack of simplicity are two factors that explain this decline, but there is also a lack of common vision. Indeed, until now, our habits consisted in the recurrent creation of small roleplays, rarely finalized and gathering at most only 4 or 5 active players. This overload of roleplays reflects a lack of global vision, that is, a roleplaying guideline that would guide our game. It also reflects a generalized boredom that we try to erase by the excessive addition of new roleplays, in turn abandoned.</p>
        <p>My solution to this problem is the occasional organization of regional events. These events would be similar to N-Day or Z-Day, but on a regional scale. Regional events are a good way to connect a community, while providing an interesting roleplaying line on which all members can participate. The selection of regional events would be by democratic vote, and their organization will be conceded to the Ministry of Roleplay. In order to increase the visibility of our region, and to guarantee a certain quality of roleplay, the events will be organized on the NationStates forum and will be supervised by a moderation team selected by the Minister of Roleplay.</p>
        <p>In the case of a competition, competition or activity that creates adversity, the regional event may lead to the awarding of prizes to winners and participants in the form of economic bonuses, political diplomatic or other matters that will be taken into account in the future roleplays of the region.</p>
